# short message from the Coordinator

### January, 2025
- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Gideon Kruseman (@ForesightAndMetrics). From 2022 to the end of 2024, I led Work Package 3 in the Foresight Systems Initiative in CGIAR see: [initiative proposal](https://www.cgiar.org/initiative/24-foresight-and-metrics-to-accelerate-inclusive-and-sustainable-agrifood-system-transformation/). In that capacity I managed this repository. The Foresight Initiative has come to an end and is incorporated in the CGIAR Science Portfolio: Policy Innovations Science Program. Stayy tuned to who will coordinate this repo in future.
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in the radical democratization of foresight analysis by ensuring FAIR foresight data and metrics and open source foresight tools
- üå± At the end of 2023 new material was finalized and added to the reposirory.
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on cool foresight models and tools and related data and metrics the model outputs, publications and related documentation will be available through the [foresight web-portal](https://foresight.cgiar.org/). The webportal went through a major revamp during the Foresight Initiative era.
