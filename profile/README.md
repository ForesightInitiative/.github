# short message from the Coordinator
### January, 2024
- 👋 Hi, I’m Gideon Kruseman (@ForesightAndMetrics). I lead Work Package 3 in the Foresight Systems Initiative in CGIAR see: [initiative proposal](https://www.cgiar.org/initiative/24-foresight-and-metrics-to-accelerate-inclusive-and-sustainable-agrifood-system-transformation/). In that capacity I manage this repository.
- 👀 I’m interested in the radical democratization of foresight analysis by ensuring FAIR foresight data and metrics and open source foresight tools
- 🌱 At the end of 2023 new material was finalized and added to the reposirory.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on cool foresight models and tools and related data and metrics the model outputs, publications and related documentation will be available through the [foresight web-portal](https://foresight.cgiar.org/). The webportal is undergoing a revamp and will change appreance over the next few months.
